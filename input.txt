Hello World!

This is my group project, and i hope you like the effort we put into this application.

We learnt alot and really enjoyed the process of making this project.

This is a random story about little red Ridding hood as best as i can rememeber it.

Little red ridding hood went to a forest.

And in the forest a fox wanted to eat her.

so he ate her.

The end.
